//Exercise 2: TXT File Handling
//Tasks:
//Add a new user:
//Allow the user to add a new login:password pair to the file.
//Ensure the login is unique.
//Change a password:
//Allow the user to modify the password for an existing login.
//Verify credentials:
//Check if a given login and password pair exist and are correct.
//File validations:
//Check the file's type and size.
//Ensure only .txt files are used and prevent the program from processing excessively large files (e.g., over 1MB).
//Display all users:
//Show all user logins (but hide their passwords).
//Delete a user:
//Allow the user to remove a user based on their login.
//Other features:
//Encrypt passwords before saving to the file.
//Validate strong password rules (e.g., at least 8 characters, includes letters and numbers).

//Instructions for Implementation:
//Set up the project:
//Create a C# console application and add the necessary references for file handling.
//File paths:
//Use relative paths so that your program can run regardless of its directory.
//Use cases:
//Implement methods for each task (e.g., AddRecord, DeleteRecord) and use menus for user interaction.
//Error handling:
//Include appropriate try-catch blocks for exceptions like file not found or invalid input.
